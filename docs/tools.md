# Device tool contract (protocol 1)

The tools this extension declares in [`nihmbus.extension.json`](../nihmbus.extension.json) and the
[PopCraft Nihmbus plugin](https://github.com/getpopcraft/popcraft-plugin-nihmbus) implements. The relay itself (pairing,
polling, uploads) is Nihmbus core: see
[extension devices](https://github.com/nihmbus/nihmbus/blob/main/docs/extension-devices.md).

Both sides send `X-Nihmbus-Extension-Protocol: 1`. Change a tool incompatibly → bump `device.protocol` here and the
plugin's `EXTENSION_PROTOCOL` together, and release both.

## Windows (`target`)

Nihmbus core adds an optional `target` argument to every tool and strips it before the plugin sees the arguments: it
picks which open PopCraft tab runs the call (each tab reports itself as a session). Results gain `window` and
`otherWindows`. The plugin only has to report its session on each poll and show the coloured icon when Nihmbus says
it is the active one. Spec: [extension devices §3a](https://github.com/nihmbus/nihmbus/blob/main/docs/extension-devices.md).

## `status`

Arguments: none.

Result:

```json
{
  "plugin": { "id": "popcraft.nihmbus", "version": "0.1.0", "protocol": 1 },
  "page": { "id": "…", "name": "Page 1", "childIds": ["…"] },
  "selection": [{ "id": "…", "name": "Poster", "type": "FRAME" }]
}
```

## `call`

Arguments: either `{ method, args? }` or `{ calls: [{ method, args? }, …] }` (1–50, run in order, stopping at the first
error). `method` is one of the PopCraft plugin API methods listed in the manifest's enum. `args` is the method's
**positional** argument list, exactly as the [plugin API reference](https://popcraft.app/docs/plugins/api-reference)
shows it (`["FRAME", { "name": "Poster" }]` for `createNode(type, props)`, `[{ … }]` for the object-style motion
methods).

Result: `{ "results": [<the method's return value>, …] }`, one entry per call. A failed call fails the whole command
with that method's error message and the index it stopped at: `call 3 (setKeyframes): …`.

Excluded on purpose (not in the enum, and refused by the plugin): anything that opens UI or new documents, reads or
writes plugin storage or file data, opens links, uploads, reads or sets site environment variables, imports from URLs
on the user's behalf (`addAudio`, `importDocumentFile`, `setPresentationAudioClip`), spends AI credits
(`requestPresentationAudio`), and `exportNode` (use `export`).

## `export`

Arguments: `{ nodeId, format?: "PNG"|"JPG"|"WEBP"|"SVG"|"PDF" (PNG), scale?: 0.1–8 (1), filename? }`.

The plugin renders the layer with `exportNode`, asks Nihmbus for a presigned upload URL, uploads the file with the
plugin `upload` API (≤ 500 MB), and reports it.

Result: `{ "exported": { "nodeId": "…", "format": "PNG", "bytes": 12345 } }` plus one file, which the agent receives as
`{ name, contentType, size, url }`.
